Hello! I am a Bioengineering undergraduate at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with a minor in Computer Science.

I am interested in creating artificial intelligence systems to advance healthcare and accelerate biomedical discoveries. Specifically, I have developed computational tools and AI algorithms for cancer diagnosis on histopathology images. I enjoy working on improving the robustness of AI models on diverse, multi-institutional patient cohorts and enhancing the trustworthiness of automated diagnoses.

# Academic Interests
- Biomedical AI
- Computational modeling of diseases
- Out-of-distribution shifts
- Histopathology, spatial transcriptomics
- Cell and tissue engineering
- 3D bioprinting

I am part of the [Illinois Engineering Ambassadors](https://ambassadors.grainger.illinois.edu/), a professional outreach program that provides engaging, hands-on presentations and activities on engineering topics to K-12 students in the Champaign County area. I have developed technical communication and teaching skills thanks to this program and represented our chapter at the [Engineering Ambassadors Network conference](https://www.engineeringambassadorsnetwork.org/) in 2025. Advised by [Dr. Jenny Amos](https://bioengineering.illinois.edu/people/jamos) and [Joan Brown](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joan-brown-73738215a).
